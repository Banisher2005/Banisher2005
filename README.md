Hi there 👋 I'm Abhinav Kumar

💻 I enjoy coding and problem-solving, mostly in Java and Python.
📘 Currently studying Advanced Programming, Vector Calculus, and a bit of AI/ML.
🧩 I like working on real, hands-on projects.
🎨 I don’t use artificial or ready-made stuff — everything I build is fully handmade.
🧠 I focus on logic, learning, and creativity, whether it’s in code or design.
⚡ Fun fact: I’d rather spend time perfecting something small than using a shortcut.
